# Sentiment Analysis
This is a sentiment analysis project that uses Naive Bayes to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset used for this project consists of 50000 reviews from IMDb, which have been labeled as either positive or negative. The Naive Bayes algorithm has been trained on this data and is capable of accurately classifying new movie reviews based on their sentiment.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following packages installed in order to run this project:

-NumPy
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Scikit-learn
-NLTK
## Installing
Use the following command to install all the required packages:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
## Running the Project
Once you have the required packages installed, you can run the project using the following command:
> python sentiment_analysis.py
## Results
The Naive Bayes algorithm achieved an accuracy of 82.8% on the test data. This indicates that the algorithm is capable of accurately classifying movie reviews based on their sentiment. Further improvement can be made by using more advanced machine learning algorithms or by increasing the size of the training data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis. The algorithm was able to achieve a decent accuracy of 82.8% on the test data. The project serves as a starting point for further exploration and improvement in the field of sentiment analysis.
